- Follow Go Proverbs: https://go-proverbs.github.io/
- Make the zero value useful ("Make the zero value useful").
- Keep interfaces small and few ("The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction").
- Prefer copying over excessive dependencies ("A little copying is better than a little dependency").
- Avoid implicit magic in code ("Clear is better than clever").
- Use named parameters only if it improves readability.
- Use channels to organize data flow, not for general synchronization ("Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating").
- Always mark generated files with a special comment: `// Code generated ... DO NOT EDIT.` (https://golang.org/s/generatedcode)
- Write tests that verify interface behavior.
- Maintain KISS and DRY, but don't overcomplicate architecture unnecessarily.
