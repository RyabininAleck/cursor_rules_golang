- Accept interfaces, return structs.
- Small interfaces - one method or a few related ones.
- Define interfaces at the point of use, not at the point of implementation.
- Don't create interfaces in advance - only when needed (YAGNI).
- Name with the `-er` suffix: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Handler`.
- Use to abstract external dependencies (DB, HTTP, queues).
- In tests - mock interfaces, not real implementations.
