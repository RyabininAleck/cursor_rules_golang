- Follow Clean Architecture: separate code into layers (handlers/controllers, services, repositories).
- Use dependency injection through constructors, not through global variables.
- Isolate business logic from frameworks (Gin, HTTP) - use interfaces.
- Store data models in the `internal/models` package.
- Place HTTP handlers in `internal/api` in files `handlers.go`, `router.go`, `<domain>_handlers.go`.
- Place business logic in `internal/service`.
- Place data access in `internal/repository`.
- Use `internal/` for code that should not be imported from outside.
- Place application entry points in `cmd/`.
- Store configuration in `internal/config`.
- Avoid circular dependencies between packages.
- Use interfaces to abstract dependencies between layers.
