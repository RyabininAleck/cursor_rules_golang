- All business logic must be extracted into pure functions without side effects.
- Pure functions should accept input data through parameters and return results without modifying external state.
- Always create unit tests for each pure function covering various input scenarios.
- Pure functions should be stored in the service layer, next to where they are used.
- Use interfaces and dependency injection to isolate business logic dependencies.
- Write a single-line comment for each function.
- Comment format: //FuncName - function purpose.
